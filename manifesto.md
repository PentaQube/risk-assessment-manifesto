- ### **Principles of Risk Assessment**
	- **Risk Assessments Are for Informed Decision-Making**
		- If a risk assessment doesn't aid our decisions, we choose not to conduct it.
	- **Risks Should Be Clear and Simple**
		- We define, clarify, and simplify risks to be understood by everyone, not just the assessors.
	- **Only Validated Risks in the Register**
		- We ensure all risks are verified before adding them, maintaining the integrity of our risk register.
	- **One Risk Register for the Entire Organization**
		- One organization, one risk register, fostering consistency and cohesion.
	- **Capture Risks Proactively at the Source**
		- We document risks as soon as they emerge, not months later.
	- **Value Context Over Processes**
		- Understanding the environment of a risk guides us more than strict adherence to procedures.
	- **Quantify High-Stake Risks**
		- Significant risks deserve accurate measurement to inform our strategies.
	- **Recognize the Limitations of Qualitative Risk Assessments**
		- We approach qualitative risk evaluations with awareness, understanding their constraints.
